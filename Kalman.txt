x = Estimated State Vector
x' = Predicted State Vector
F = State Transition Matrix
H = Measurement Function
u = External motion of system
P = Uncertainty covariance
P' = Predicted Uncertainty covariance
Y = Innovation or Error
R = Measurement Noise
K = Kalman Gain
Z = Measurement

Measurement Update
-Find the innovation
-Find Kalman Gain
-Correct the state estimate
-Correct the P estimate (P')
	Y = Z - Hx
	x' = x + KY
	P' = (I - KH)P


Predict
-Predict future state
-Predict future co-variance
